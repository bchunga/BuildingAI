# Blueprints Maker
Building AI course project

## Summary
There are basic concepts when making architect blueprints that can be easily automated, like make simple walls or rooms. In addition, for an inexperienced person it can be of great help to obtain a base blueprints only specified a few characteristics.

## Backgroung
When making a blueprtins, the base or initial parts can be tedious, or simply take time. However, through an AI it would be possible to generate default blueprints through given characteristics, and start working with a base plane instead of starting from 0, which would save time and even help in case of not having a clear idea on how to start.

## How is it used?
The program works as follows:
* The essential characteristics such as the number of floors, rooms, bathrooms, size of the land, etc. are entered.
* The program generates different blueprints based on the specified characteristics.
* The user chooses the blueprint of his preference among the different options generated.
* Once a base blueprint has been chosen, it can be edited to fit it more to the user's needs.

## Data sources and AI methods
To train the AI, the standard measurements can be specified for each type of room so that it is capable of generating an acceptable result in case the user has not indicated a preference. You must also specify the essential rooms that each type of construction has, such as for a house or a business.
For the design to be complete, the AI must provide solutions that consider factors such as the use of natural light or air currents in the area.
The AI must be able to optimize the space of the land and the measurements according to the number of floors and rooms, in addition to generating an estimated budget for the construction.

## What next?
To improve the project, the ability to increase the electrical blueprints for the construction could be added.
